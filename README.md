This utility gives a simple way to create a tartan bitmap from the tartan's threadcount and the colour palette it uses. It can be used to generate bitmaps of tartans registered rin the Scottish Register of Tartans or to create custom ones.

For example, a threadcount of `K15R3K5DR3` says: weave 15 units of K, 3 units of R, 5 units of K and 3 units of DR. An attached colour palette then gives specification of the colours K, R and DR in hexadecimal colour codes. For example, `R=C80000;DR=800028;K=101010` (Red, Dark Red, and blacK).
